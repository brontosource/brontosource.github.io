          Founded in September of 2024, BrontoSource is a team of energetic
          ex-Google engineers focused on creating tools to modernize codebases
          automatically. Our first target is automatic migration of C/C++ to
          idiomatic Rust for large code bases.

          Matt spent the past eleven years at Google where he led the Software
          Ecosystems organization as a Principal Engineer. During that time he
          designed language and library features for migration, as well as
          directly planning and executing multiple migrations of previously
          unapproachable difficulty. Rust’s{" "}
          <code>std::collections::HashMap</code> is based directly on his work.

          Andy spent the past eight years at Google where he led the C++
          Refactoring team as a Staff Engineer. During that time he designed and
          implemented novel technologies and techniques for source-to-source
          migrations across Google’s monorepo, as well as executing those
          migrations over hundreds of millions of lines of code.
