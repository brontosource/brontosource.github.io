            Founded in September of 2024, BrontoSource is a team of energetic
            ex-Google engineers focused on creating tools to modernize codebases
            automatically. Our first target is automatic migration of C/C++ to
            idiomatic Rust for large code bases.

            Matt spent the past eleven years at Google where he led the Software
            Ecosystems organization as a Principal Engineer. During that time he
            designed language and library features for migration, as well as
            directly planning and executing multiple migrations of previously
            unapproachable difficulty. Rust’s{" "}
            <code>std::collections::HashMap</code> is based directly on his
            work.

            Andy spent the past eight years at Google where he led the C++
            Refactoring team as a Staff Engineer. During that time he designed
            and implemented novel technologies and techniques for
            source-to-source migrations across Google’s monorepo, as well as
            executing those migrations over hundreds of millions of lines of
            code.
