        BrontoSource provides incremental, reproducible, understandable migrations
        that fit into existing workflows leaving behind clean, idiomatic code.
        BrontoSource migrates components of large systems independently, allowing
        developers to extend their codebase while the upgrade progresses in the
        background, modernizing your codebase and eliminating long-term risks.
        <p />
        Effective migrations require incremental updates that provide
        incremental value. Bug-for-bug replacements are routinely behind
        schedule, over budget, and leave a nest of special case logic that
        developers are afraid to change. Full system rewrites delay the
        technical risk to deployment, causing unexpected delays and late
        discovery of{" "}
        <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">implicit requirements</a>. In both
        cases, teams have to maintain two systems while the second one is being
        built, splitting their focus and efforts.
        <p />
        After BrontoSource has finished modernizing a codebase, it can continue
        operating in the background providing ongoing updates and security
        patches ensuring your codebase stays clean into the future.
